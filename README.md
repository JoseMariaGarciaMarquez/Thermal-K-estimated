# Thermal-K-estimated

###This project aims to estimate the thermal conductivity of a well using well log data. It proposes a function that calculates the thermal conductivity based on the volumes of clay and sand, considering their respective conductivity values. The function takes into account the porosity information from the well log data to provide a comprehensive estimation.
